"""
This script outlines the high-level steps for building a business-focused LLM using open-source models like Llama or DeepSeek.

Sections:
1. Setup environment and dependencies
2. Load and preprocess business data
3. Download base LLM weights
4. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
5. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context
7. Export and deploy model

# 1. Setup environment (install PyTorch, transformers, etc.)
def setup_environment():
    # Setup virtual environment and install packages
    pass

# 2. Load and preprocess data
def load_and_preprocess_data():
    # Load business_data.jsonl and clean text
    pass

# 3. Download base model weights
def download_base_model():
    # Use HuggingFace CLI or git-lfs to download Llama3 or DeepSeek weights
    pass

# 4. Train the model with supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
def train_sft_model():
    # Tokenize data and train using transformers.Trainer
    pass

# 5. Train a reward model and perform RLHF
def train_reward_and_rlhf():
    # Train reward model and run PPO loop
    pass

# 6. Setup RAG for embedding business documents
def setup_rag():
    # Chunk documents, embed with sentence-transformers, and store in vector DB
    pass

# 7. Serve the model via API
def serve_model():
    # Create FastAPI endpoints for inference
    pass

# Main function orchestrates the pipeline
